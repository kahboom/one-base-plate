# OneBasePlate Agent Progress

## Conventions
- Work on one feature at a time per the PRD implementation order
- Run tests before marking any feature as passing
- Commit after each completed feature

## Completed Features

### F001 - Repository scaffold (2026-03-12)
- Created Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffold (package.json, tsconfig, vite.config, eslint.config)
- Defined TypeScript types in src/types.ts matching all PRD data model entities
- Created 3 household fixture files (H001, H002, H003) covering all persona types
- Created 1 meal fixture (pasta-base.json)
- Set up vitest with jsdom environment and test setup
- Created scaffold test suite (7 tests, all passing)
- Updated init.sh to install deps, type-check, run tests, and start dev server
- Verified: tsc --noEmit passes, vitest passes, vite build succeeds

### F002 - Household setup with multiple members (2026-03-12)
- Created localStorage storage layer (src/storage.ts) with CRUD operations for households
- Created HouseholdList page showing saved households with create/delete actions
- Created HouseholdSetup page with member management (add/remove members, set name/role/texture)
- Added react-router-dom routing in App.tsx (extracted BrowserRouter to main.tsx for testability)
- Installed @testing-library/user-event for interaction tests
- Created 8 tests covering storage CRUD, household creation with 4 members of mixed roles, re-opening persisted households, member removal, and household list display
- Verified: tsc --noEmit passes, vitest passes (15 tests), vite build succeeds
